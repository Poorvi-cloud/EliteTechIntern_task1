ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Big Data Analysis

Tool Used: PySpark Dataset: NYC Taxi Trip Data

What I Did: Used PySpark to handle and analyze a large CSV dataset (taxi_tripdata.csv) efficiently. Performed data cleaning, selected relevant columns, and computed insights such as trip distances, fare amounts, and passenger counts. Aggregated data to find top zones by trip count and calculated average fares and distances. Outcome: Successfully demonstrated scalable big data processing using PySpark with insightful visual and tabular analysis.
